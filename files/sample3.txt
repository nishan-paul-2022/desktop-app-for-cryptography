Concept behind the story : Time inversion, Reverse Entropy, Temporal pincer movement
Meaning of ‘Tenet’ : A palindromic word which means ten minutes forward in time, ten minutes backward in time (indicates the climax scenery)
Review : A magnificent piece of art in cinema history that we need, but not the one we deserve right now (Corona fact, I think). The concept of reverse entropy surely is not new for theoretical physic. But introducing it in a movie on a large scale demands a completely new set of skills and technical difficulties, which we may even find hard to imagine. I don’t even dare to write a detailed explanation of the story. It’s too much complicated to put in a single writing.
Don’t go along with critics. Watch it, find explanations as much as you can (especially from Reddit), analyze it, and re-watch. Audience shouldn’t expect a typical mind-bending twisted action-thriller or compare it with Inception / Interestellar for self-explanatory dialogues. Story doesn’t demand it, and for the sake of screenplay, movie seems to go faster. Absorb this movie as a puzzle, and go through rigorous brainstorming to solve it. Then you may feel the real beauty of Tenet.
Hats off to Chris. No wonder why he is way ahead of our time. A most ambitious project from the most visionary director of our time.
